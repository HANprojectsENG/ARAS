HAN Minor Embedded Vision Design - AR Assembly Support Project

Augmented reality support system for assembling LEGOs onto a baseplate. This is a demonstration of the technology that can be enhanced to assist factory workers assembling hard to manufacture or small batch products. The system developed is meant to attach to existing workstations and be easy and cost effective to implement. With that in mind this system is made using a 3D-printed housing on a lamp stand which is holding a projector, a Raspberry Pi 4, and a Raspberry Pi camera. These are used in combination to read from the desk below all position, orientation,
and color values of legos and then project instructions to the user about what to do next.
